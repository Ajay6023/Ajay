Introducing Hyde
28 Dec 2013
Hyde is a brazen two-column Jekyll theme that pairs a prominent sidebar with uncomplicated content. It’s based on Poole, the Jekyll butler.


Built on Poole
Poole is the Jekyll Butler, serving as an upstanding and effective foundation for Jekyll themes by @mdo. Poole, and every theme built on it (like Hyde here) includes the following:


Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and example page)
Mobile friendly design and development
Easily scalable text and component sizing with rem units in the CSS
Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)
Hyde features
In addition to the features of Poole, Hyde adds the following:

Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a dynamically generated navigation with active link support
Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and reverse (right sidebar), available via <body> classes
Eight optional color schemes, available via <body> classes
Head to the readme to learn more.

Browser support
Hyde is by preference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

Download
Hyde is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the GitHub repository for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!

Example content
07 Feb 2012
Howdy! This is an example blog post that shows several types of HTML content supported in this theme.
Cum sociis natoque penatibus et magnis dis parturient montes, nascetur ridiculus mus. Aenean eu leo quam. Pellentesque ornare sem lacinia quam venenatis vestibulum. Sed posuere consectetur est at lobortis. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum.

Curabitur blandit tempus porttitor. Nullam quis risus eget urna mollis ornare vel eu leo. Nullam id dolor id nibh ultricies vehicula ut id elit.

Etiam porta sem malesuada magna mollis euismod. Cras mattis consectetur purus sit amet fermentum. Aenean lacinia bibendum nulla sed consectetur.

Inline HTML elements
HTML defines a long list of available inline tags, a complete list of which can be found on the Mozilla Developer Network.

To bold text, use <strong>.
To italicize text, use <em>.
Abbreviations, like HTML should use <abbr>, with an optional title attribute for the full phrase.
Citations, like — Mark otto, should use <cite>.
Deleted text should use <del> and inserted text should use <ins>.
Superscript text uses <sup> and subscript text uses <sub>.
Most of these elements are styled by browsers with few modifications on our part.
